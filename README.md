# used_car_analysis

This repo contains a data set and a jupyter notebook. The data set contains data on used cars including their listed price. The jupyter notebook contains an analysis of the data and the application of multiple machine learning algorithms to the data. The goal of the jupyter notebook is to show how we can use machine learning models to predict the price of used cars based on the data set we're given.

One may use this method to train their own machine learning algorithm. You could then feed individual used cars through the algorithm to predict their price. If the algorithm predicts a price that is significantly higher than the listed price, then one can reasonably think this car may be a "bargain".
